### Install Icons in the Project

The Icons of the project were downloaded at the web page fortawesome (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/react-fontawesome). Next, We show how to install the pakage:

[npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons]

### Use Icons on components

We need to import the next:

[import { FontAwesomeIcon } from "@fortawesome/react-fontawesome";]
[import { faGreaterThan } from "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons";]

In this case, "faGreaterThan" means the icon we need to show to the user
